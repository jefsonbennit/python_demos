# function 
# A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.
# You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.
# A function can return data as a result
# All functions are static definitions

# function definition
# it tells what the function is going to do for the interpretor \ compiler

# interpretor 
# reads the code line and then executes it

# compiler 
# converts the code into 0s and 1s and then executes it
